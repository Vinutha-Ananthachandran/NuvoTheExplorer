# 🐢✨ The Tale of Nuvo and Nuvi: The Great Maze Adventure ✨🐢

Once upon a time, in a bright green meadow, there lived two robot best friends
named Nuvo and Nuvi. They did everything together, racing to the pond, nibbling on
tasty lettuce, and playing hide-and-seek under the tall flowers.

One sunny afternoon, Nuvi, the adventurous one, spotted a mysterious maze nearby.
She giggled and said, “Let’s make hide-and-seek even more fun! I’ll hide inside the maze, and you come find
me!”

Nuvi scurried into the maze, but it was trickier than it looked! The walls twisted and
turned, and soon she was giggling from somewhere deep inside, calling: “Nuvo, come find me if you can!”

Now it’s up to Nuvo (the player’s turtle) to guide his way through the maze, step by
step, until he finds his best friend. But he must be careful—not every path leads to Nuvi, and the maze has plenty of dead ends!

Will you help Nuvo use his turtle powers to find Nuvi and bring her back safely?
